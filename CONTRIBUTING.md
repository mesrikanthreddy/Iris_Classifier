# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this AI/ML project! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## About This Project

This project is designed as an educational resource for beginners interested in machine learning. It demonstrates:
- Basic data loading and exploration
- Model training and evaluation
- Making predictions with trained models

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:
1. Check if the issue already exists in the GitHub issues
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - A detailed description of the problem or suggestion
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for new features or improvements:
- For new algorithms: Implement different classifiers (SVM, KNN, etc.)
- For visualization: Add more charts or interactive elements
- For documentation: Improve explanations or add examples
- For performance: Optimize code or add efficiency metrics

### 3. Code Contributions

To contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes
5. Commit your changes with a clear message
6. Push to your fork
7. Create a pull request

### 4. Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled "good first issue" if you're new to contributing:
- Add documentation comments to functions
- Improve error handling
- Add unit tests
- Create additional example datasets

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the project: `python simple_iris_classifier.py`

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

- Ensure the code runs without errors
- Verify that output is as expected
- Test with different input values when possible

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update examples if needed

## Getting Help

If you need help with your contribution:
1. Check the documentation in README.md
2. Look at existing code for examples
3. Ask questions in the issue tracker
4. Join relevant community forums or chat groups
